### Warning, this program is potentially unsafe, no copies or backups are made of the acted-on TAR V7 files. This should only be used in environments where an archive is fetched, appended, and reuploaded, such as in a server backup environment where the archive won't get lost forever if it's destroyed. Alongside this, all symbolic links are destroyed.
